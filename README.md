# When instaling Drivers!
When you Unzip and open the Extracted folder you will see 4-7 folders named for example ("audio","graphics","power") You will go in Each one and run the Setup.exe, This will then start the Driver install, After it all you will have to go to C:/DRIVERS/WIN/... Inside you will see the Drivers Folders! To finish the install of my T41's Graphics drivers I will go into it and run "Setup.exe" This will run the needed Updates and Installs to Windows, If you have Questions or Concerns please reach out to me on my discord
